# HTML Extractor: Split HTML, CSS, and JS

This Python script extracts inline CSS and JavaScript from an HTML file and saves them into separate `styles.css` and `scripts.js` files. It then modifies the original HTML to link to the external CSS and JS files. It also includes an interactive overlay that appears when the script starts.

## Features:
- Extracts inline CSS and JavaScript from HTML files.
- Saves the CSS and JS into separate files.
- Modifies the original HTML to link to the new CSS and JS files.
- Displays a splash screen before starting the extraction process.
- Prettifies HTML, CSS and JS files before writing. (Optional, enabled through prompt)

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `beautifulsoup4` library (for parsing HTML)
- `tkinter` library (for showing splash screen, file chooser)

### Installation:
1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   pip install tkinter
   ```

*The `tkinter` library is pre-installed in Windows, no need to type in `pip install tkinter`

### Usage:
1. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The script will ask whether you want to open a file dialog to select an HTML file or provide a file path manually.

3. Once the HTML file is selected, the script extracts the CSS and JS, saves them into separate files, and updates the HTML accordingly.

### Example Output:
- `index.html` - Modified HTML file with links to `styles.css` and `scripts.js`.
- `styles.css` - Extracted CSS.
- `scripts.js` - Extracted JavaScript.

### Notes:
- The script works by parsing the HTML file, finding all inline CSS and JavaScript, and saving them in separate files.
- The splash screen window is shown for 2 seconds when the script starts.
